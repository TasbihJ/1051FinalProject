            Serenity is a collection of time-lapses I've recorded over time. I've always found the sky to be fascinating; the clouds, the moon, 
            the rain, and everything the sky brings with it. Pictures are great but they never capture the full beauty, or the movemnt that gives the
            sky life. Videos, on the other hand, do capture movement; however, the movement of the clouds and most natural bodies 
            happen in such a slow interval, that ooneen would have to record for at least a minute in order to see some movement within 
            the video. If there is no information needed to gain from watching a video, most people's attention span will not last 
            beyond 15 seconds. The first time-lapse I ever recorded a time-lapse of the sky, it was a spur of a moment. I did not know what the outcome would be. 
            Once I replayed it back to myself, I fell in love. It was perfect. It was not long and it captured the beauty and changes of the sky perfectly. 
            I could see the path the clouds moved in, the sky changing different colors and the life around, busy as ever. All in just 15 seconds. 
            Since then, I have been recording time-lapses whenever I could. It has become one of my favorite things to do to pass time, and if I'm recording 
            then I'm not on my phone, so I can get other work done.
